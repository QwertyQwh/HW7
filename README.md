## Naive implementation

The atoi() version takes about 0.09 sec on my virtual machine and the naive implementation takes about 0.005 sec, which is about 20 times faster. 

## Optimization
I aggregated a few arithmetic operations to get a boost of 0.00005 sec. However the overall run time is still a little above 0.005.
